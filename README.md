## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile Methodology

Description: Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that focuses on adaptability, flexibility, and collaboration. Teams work in short iterations (often called sprints), with frequent feedback and adjustments based on changing requirements.

Main Advantages:

Flexibility: Allows teams to adapt quickly to changing requirements and customer feedback.
Increased transparency: Regular collaboration and visibility into the development process enhance communication and accountability.
Improved quality: Iterative testing and continuous feedback loop help identify and resolve defects early.
Faster time-to-market: Short iterations and frequent delivery of working software reduce the overall development time.

Main Disadvantages:
Lack of formal planning: Insufficient up-front planning can lead to scope creep and project delays.
Requirement volatility: Frequent changes can disrupt the development process and result in rework.
Communication challenges: Agile teams often rely heavily on face-to-face communication, which can be difficult for distributed teams.


Waterfall Methodology
Description: Waterfall is a sequential approach to software development that follows a predefined sequence of phases (e.g., requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment). Each phase is completed before the next one can begin.

Main Advantages:
Clear documentation: Extensive documentation is created during each phase, providing a detailed plan and traceability.
Well-structured: The predefined process and clear milestones ensure consistent delivery and reduce the risk of missing deadlines.
Predictable schedules: The phased approach allows for accurate scheduling and resource allocation.
Reduced rework: Formal reviews and testing at each phase minimize the need for rework later in the process.

Main Disadvantages:
Less adaptable: Waterfall is less flexible and less suited for projects with changing requirements or uncertain scope.
Slower time-to-market: The sequential nature of the process can delay the delivery of working software.
Communication challenges: Handoffs between phases can lead to misunderstandings and information loss.

Comparison Summary:

| Flexibility            | High                       | Low                    | 
| Adaptability to change | Good                       | Poor                   | 
| Time-to-market         | Faster                     | Slower                 | 
| Customer involvement   | High                       | Low                    | 
| Communication          | Frequent and collaborative | Formal and structured  | 
| Planning               | Incremental and iterative  | Extensive and up-front | 
| Documentation          | Minimal                    | Extensive              | 
| Risk of rework         | Lower                      | Higher                 |
